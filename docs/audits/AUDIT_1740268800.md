## Specification Health

| Spec | Status | Age | Traceability |
|------|--------|-----|--------------|
| toy-example-app.md | APPROVED | 44 days | Empty (low priority) |
| version-upgrade-multi-machine.md | SUPERSEDED | 27 days | N/A |
| toy-app-v3.md | IMPLEMENTING | 6 days | Complete |

## Documentation Health

All 10 referenced docs exist with substantive content. No broken links.

**WARN:** README.md endpoint list and architecture diagram are pre-v3. Missing: `/submit-data`, `/delete-data/:receiptId`, `/report`, `/reports`. Architecture diagram does not show 3-CVM model.

---

## Git State

12 uncommitted changes consistent with active v3 implementation:
- 6 modified files (index.ts, config.ts, signup-counter.ts, package.json, package-lock.json, version-upgrade spec)
- 6 new files (database.ts, user-data.ts, deletion-attestation.ts, report-generator.ts, postgres/ compose files, pull-report workflow, verify-report script)

---

## Recommendations

1. **[WARN] Update README.md** — Add v3 endpoints and 3-CVM architecture diagram
2. **[INFO] Backfill traceability** — Original toy-example-app.md has empty traceability table
3. **[INFO] Commit work** — 12 changes ready for commit once review complete
